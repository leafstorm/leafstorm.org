Here are some of the presentations and talks I've given at conferences,

## Traversing the Montréal Métro with Python

In this lightning talk, I explain how my dad and I rode the entire
métro of Montréal in 2 hours 52 minutes, using Python to find the fastest
possible route.

## Iterators and Generators Tutorial

This talk is a basic introduction to iterators and generators in Python.
It explains where iterators and generators appear, why they're useful,
and how you can write your own.
