Here are some of the presentations and talks I've given at conferences,

## Traversing the Montréal Métro with Python

PyCon --- April 2014 --- Montréal, QC, Canada

In this lightning talk, I explain how my dad and I rode the entire
métro of Montréal in 2 hours 52 minutes, using Python to find the fastest
possible route.
